# ToonTanks
 Udemy tutorial project

Scripts are located under Source/ToonTanks

The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with creating actors with seperate components, namely the tank body, turret base, and cannons.

I also used this for learning how to create projectiles and register hits.
